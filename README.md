Iconography Translator: Making the Web Understandable
Does a "squiggle" mean draft or delete? Is that cloud icon for upload or backup?

Icons are meant to simplify the web, but for many users—including those with cognitive disabilities, low digital literacy, or anyone navigating a complex new app—ambiguous icons can be a major barrier.

Iconography Translator bridges this gap by turning mysterious symbols into clear, human-readable text.

Key Features:
🔍 Smart Detection: Hover over any icon, SVG, or button to instantly see its intended name. Our "Icon Detective" analyzes ARIA labels, Alt text, and CSS properties to find the best description.

✍️ Personal Dictionary: If an icon’s name is still unclear (like "octicon-plus"), you can right-click it and define it yourself! Rename it to "Add New Project" or "Create Document" to suit your needs.

💡 Contextual Hints: Go beyond simple names. Add custom hints like "Used for saving drafts" to help remember complex workflows.

🌍 Language-Aware: The extension detects the website's language, allowing you to save different definitions for different languages or set "Global" meanings.

🤝 Crowdsourced Sharing: Export your custom icon library as a JSON file to share with friends, students, or colleagues, or import a library created by the community.
